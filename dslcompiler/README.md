# MAL (the Meta Attack Language)

The Meta Attack Language is, as its name suggests, a meta language that specifies all the rules and the elements for domain specific languages. It is an efficient way to avoid creating new attack graphs for every different case on the domain under study. MAL additionally promotes the re-usability of specified elements and has as a final goal to reduce the effort needed by a specific language developer in order to develop the language. As one can expect, it comes together with its respective compiler called MAL compiler.

## Getting Started

These instructions will guide you on how to have a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

Since this is a Maven project it is ought to be opened by any compatible IDE or to be used with the mvn command line tool.

To build the MAL compiler, which can be later used to create domain specific languages (DSLs), such as [VehicleLang](https://github.com/pontusj101/vehicleLang), simply issue the following command on the command line:

```
mvn clean install
```
